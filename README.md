# Overview: 2024 - A New Race, New Insights

After a year of focused training, I ran my second street race in 2024, and I hit my target: placing within the top 50%! It felt incredible, but as I reviewed my results, new questions arose. I realized there’s so much more to explore in the data, beyond my placement alone.

Now, I want to analyze how my performance compares across specific runner subgroups and explore how advanced statistics might reveal patterns among returning competitors. Could I identify trends or even make predictions about future race placements?

# Objectives
In this next phase, my goals are to:
#### - Investigate Placement Across Different Runner Segments:
  I'll explore how my performance stacks up against specific runner groups, such as age brackets, those running in teams, and perhaps even solo vs. team runners.
#### - Analyze Advanced Statistics for Insightful Comparisons:
Delve into statistics that go beyond averages and percentiles, using techniques like ANOVA to assess performance variance between groups and clustering to find patterns among runners.
#### - Predict Returning Runners and Future Placements: 
Using historical data, I’ll attempt to forecast which runners are likely to participate again and predict their potential placements based on past results.

# Methodology
### Data Collection and Preparation
- I’ll gather race data from 2023 and 2024, combining them for a multi-year dataset. This will involve downloading, extracting, and transforming data from PDFs as before.
- I'll create a structured database with both years' data, storing additional fields like runner demographics (age, gender) and team information to enable subgroup analysis.

### Advanced Analysis
- Descriptive Statistics: I'll begin with summaries by group (e.g., age groups, solo vs. party runners) to understand performance patterns.
- Comparative Analysis: Using statistical tests (such as t-tests or ANOVA), I’ll examine whether performance differs significantly across groups.
- Cluster Analysis: I'll use clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) to identify natural groupings among runners, perhaps spotting trends in performance that I hadn't considered before.

### Predictive Modeling
- I'll use classification models (Random Forest, Decision Trees) to identify runners who are likely to return. For returning runners, regression models can help forecast their 2025 placements based on their improvement trends.
- Finally, I’ll incorporate external features, like training data (if available) or weather conditions on race day, to refine predictions and provide deeper insights.

### Visualization and Reporting
Power BI will remain the main visualization tool, with interactive reports allowing viewers to compare group performance, track returning runners, and explore predictive insights.

# Expected Results
By the end of this project, I’ll have:
- A nuanced understanding of my performance relative to specific runner subgroups.
- Insights into trends among returning runners and predictors for future placements.
- A data-driven plan to tailor my training to my competitive landscape and maximize my chances of ranking even higher in the next race.
